# Implementing-and-Analyzing-K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch
"This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm entirely from scratch using NumPy. A synthetic four-cluster dataset is generated, the optimal number of clusters is determined using the Silhouette Method, and final clusters are visualized alongside centroids with analysis."
